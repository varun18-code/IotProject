📡 Smart IoT Environment Monitoring System
<br>
A smart and scalable environment monitoring platform designed to collect, analyze, and visualize real-time environmental data. Ideal for applications like pollution tracking, smart agriculture, and urban infrastructure, the system is built with modularity for easy hardware extension in future deployments.

❗Note: This covers only the software aspect, we can always tweak this a little bit and integrate hardware accordingly

🌟 Key Features
Sensor-Based Data Collection: Real-time monitoring using sensors like temperature, humidity, gas (MQ), and air quality.
Cloud Integration: Sends data to platforms such as ThingSpeak or Firebase for remote access and storage.
Live Dashboard: Visual display of sensor data trends using interactive graphs.
Threshold Alerts: Custom alerts when predefined limits are exceeded.
Modular System Design: Built for easy extension with additional sensors or logic.
